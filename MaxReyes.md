# Max Reyes

## About me
Hello, to anyone reading this. My name is Max Reyes and I am currently a junior at UNCG. As of today, 1/23/2026, I have just turned 20 years old. I am looking forward to doing a lot of work in Git and Java. I have a cat named Iris, and my favorite fruit are oranges.


## My CSC-340 Goals
I hope to gain a lot of experience working in Git and Github as they both seem like such wonderful tools to use in project management, and working on a project of this size is sure to give me a lot of learning experiences. I'm most looking forward to seeing how my developments skills grow as a result of the app we create.
